<h2>about</h2>
  <p>Tanya Goncalves is an artist-researcher who has a focus in audio programming, live coding and electroacoustic composition. 
    Her work explores a curiosity for sound and the complex relationships between computer programming and the development of musical composition. 
    She is a graduate of McMaster University (Hamilton ON), where she completed her M.A. in Communication and New Media. 
    She also holds a B.A. in Communication Studies and Multimedia. 
    Tanya has worked closely with McMaster University’s Cybernetic Orchestra, a laptop orchestra that specializes in live coding in order to produce intricate improvisations and compositions. 
    She is also a co-founder and the VP of Relations and Communications at MacGDA (The McMaster Game Development Association), which is a student-run organization dedicated to video game research, and teaching others about video game design. 
    Her most recent research project was the creation of a live coded performance for mobile devices.</p>

<h2>WASP: Web Audio Sound Programming (2015)</h2>
<p>As part of my senior undergraduate thesis project at McMaster University, I created a web based live coding language called WASP.</p>
<p>WASP's details and download are available at the following link: <a href="https://hithub.com/tanyamgoncalves/WASP">https://hithub.com/tanyamgoncalves/WASP</a></p>

<h2>An Audio Programming Language Informed by the Theory of Cognitive Dimensions (2014)</h2>
<p>Funded by the USRA (Undergraduate Student Research Award) at McMaster University, I was given the opportunity to complete a two-part research program. First I completed a comparative analysis of audio programming examples in terms of Thomas Green’s cognitive dimensions (Green 1996). Green outlined 14 dimensions of code languages that influence the success of design tasks. Informed by this analysis, I then produced a small original audio programming language, leveraging the existing SuperCollider language (McCartney 1996). The language is called Hive, and it is meant to be a platform language for novice users to begin learning about musical programming, live coding, and to provide enough of a starter curiosity to explore the SuperCollider language even further.</p>
<p>Hive’s details and download are available at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/tanyamgoncalves/Hive">https://github.com/tanyamgoncalves/Hive</a></p>
